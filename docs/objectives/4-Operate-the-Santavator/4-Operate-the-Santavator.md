Wondering around the castle we will be able to find the different items, the first items found are one of the nuts and the green bulb and as we continue navigating the castle we find the red and yellow bulb, a candy cane, a blue ball, a magnetic bulb that we can arrange as shown on the image to enable the different elevator buttons.
